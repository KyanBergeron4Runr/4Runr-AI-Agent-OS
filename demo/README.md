## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start the Gateway:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run all demos:**
   ```bash
   node demo/run-all-demos.js
   ```

3. **View results:**
   ```bash
   cat demo/results/demo-summary.md
   ```

## 📊 What Each Test Proves

### 🔒 Security Test (`security-test.js`)
- **Token Expiration**: Dynamic vs static keys
- **Scope Enforcement**: Fine-grained vs all-or-nothing access
- **Tool Restrictions**: Service-specific vs universal access
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging vs no visibility

### ⚡ Performance Test (`performance-test.js`)
- **Latency Overhead**: Gateway vs direct API calls
- **Caching Effectiveness**: Built-in vs no caching
- **Throughput**: Requests per second comparison
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU efficiency

### 💰 Cost Analysis (`cost-analysis.js`)
- **Operational Costs**: Manual vs automated management
- **Security Incident Costs**: Risk reduction analysis
- **Development Time**: Integration complexity comparison
- **ROI Calculation**: 1-year and 3-year projections

### 🛡️ Resilience Test (`resilience-test.js`)
- **Circuit Breaker Effectiveness**: Failure protection
- **Recovery Time**: Automatic vs manual recovery
- **Chaos Engineering**: Simulated failure scenarios
- **Load Handling**: Concurrent request management

### 📈 Monitoring Test (`monitoring-test.js`)
- **Real-time Metrics**: Visibility comparison
- **Alerting**: Proactive vs reactive monitoring
- **Debugging**: Issue resolution time
- **Compliance**: Audit trail completeness

## 📋 Demo Results Format

Each test generates structured JSON results:
