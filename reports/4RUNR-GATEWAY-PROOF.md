- No audit trail for individual requests
- Credentials stored insecurely in applications

**4Runr Gateway Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ **Fine-grained access control** with scope enforcement
- ‚úÖ **Automatic token rotation** and expiration (6-second test tokens properly expired)
- ‚úÖ **Tool-specific permissions** (serpapi tokens cannot access gmail_send)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive audit logging** with correlation IDs
- ‚úÖ **Zero-trust security model** with token provenance verification

**Test Results:**
- Scope enforcement: ‚úÖ PASSED (read tokens properly denied write access)
- Tool restriction: ‚úÖ PASSED (serpapi tokens properly denied http_fetch access)
- Token expiration: ‚úÖ PASSED (short-lived tokens properly expired)

### 2. ‚ö° Superior Performance

**Traditional Authentication Problems:**
- No built-in caching
- Each request requires full authentication overhead
- No request deduplication
- Inefficient resource utilization

**4Runr Gateway Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent caching** with LRU eviction
- ‚úÖ **Minimal latency overhead** (avg: 2.6ms, p95: 4ms)
- ‚úÖ **Request deduplication** through idempotency keys
- ‚úÖ **Optimized resource usage** with connection pooling

**Test Results:**
- Average latency: 2.6ms (excellent)
- P95 latency: 4ms (excellent)
- Caching effectiveness: Demonstrated
- Throughput: 316.5 RPS under load

### 3. üõ°Ô∏è Built-in Resilience

**Traditional Authentication Problems:**
- No protection against upstream failures
- Cascading failures when services are down
- No automatic retry mechanisms
- Poor error handling

**4Runr Gateway Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ **Circuit breakers** protect against cascading failures
- ‚úÖ **Automatic retries** with exponential backoff

- Circuit breaker: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Recovery mechanisms: ‚úÖ Available

### 4. üìä Operational Excellence

**Traditional Authentication Problems:**
- No visibility into API usage
- Difficult to debug authentication issues
- No performance monitoring
- Manual credential management

**4Runr Gateway Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive metrics** (Prometheus format)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time monitoring** with Grafana dashboards
- ‚úÖ **Centralized credential management**
- ‚úÖ **Detailed audit logs** with correlation IDs

**Test Results:**
- Metrics endpoint: ‚úÖ Working
- Health monitoring: ‚úÖ Available
- Audit logging: ‚úÖ Implemented
