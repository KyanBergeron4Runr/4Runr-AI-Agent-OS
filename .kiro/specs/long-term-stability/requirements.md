# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the 4RUNR Gateway's long-term stability and reliability based on findings from the failed 48-hour burn-in test. The system currently demonstrates excellent short-term performance (45-minute tests with 300 RPS) but fails to maintain availability during extended operations, becoming unresponsive after approximately 5 hours of continuous operation.

The primary goal is to achieve enterprise-grade stability that can sustain 48+ hours of continuous operation under production load conditions while maintaining robust configuration management and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Extended Availability and Stability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the 4RUNR Gateway to maintain 99.9% availability during extended operations (48+ hours), so that the system can handle real-world production workloads without unexpected downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs continuously for 48 hours under production load THEN it SHALL maintain service availability without becoming unresponsive
2. WHEN the system experiences transient failures THEN it SHALL recover automatically within 60 seconds
3. WHEN monitoring health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL respond within 5 seconds at all times
4. WHEN memory usage is tracked over 48 hours THEN it SHALL NOT increase by more than 10% from baseline (no memory leaks)
5. WHEN CPU usage is monitored over 48 hours THEN it SHALL remain within 70-80% of baseline performance

### Requirement 2: Robust Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want configuration changes to be applied safely without corrupting the environment file, so that chaos engineering and feature flag toggles work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chaos injection is enabled THEN the system SHALL update configuration without file corruption
2. WHEN environment variables are modified THEN the changes SHALL be applied atomically
3. WHEN configuration updates fail THEN the system SHALL rollback to the previous valid state
4. WHEN multiple configuration changes occur simultaneously THEN they SHALL be handled with proper locking mechanisms
5. WHEN the .env file is updated THEN it SHALL maintain proper formatting and syntax

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring that continues to function even when the application becomes unresponsive, so that I can diagnose and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application becomes unresponsive THEN monitoring SHALL continue to collect system-level metrics
2. WHEN metrics collection fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 5 attempts
3. WHEN health checks fail THEN alerts SHALL be triggered within 30 seconds
4. WHEN the system recovers from failure THEN recovery time and root cause SHALL be logged
5. WHEN monitoring data is collected THEN it SHALL be persisted even if the application crashes

### Requirement 4: Graceful Degradation and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to degrade gracefully under stress and recover automatically, so that service disruptions are minimized and manual intervention is reduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system resources are exhausted THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure mechanisms
2. WHEN the database becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue serving cached responses
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL trigger garbage collection and cleanup routines
4. WHEN the system detects performance degradation THEN it SHALL automatically restart non-critical components
5. WHEN recovery is initiated THEN the system SHALL restore full functionality within 2 minutes

### Requirement 5: Platform Compatibility and Resilience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to work reliably across different platforms (Windows/WSL2, Linux, macOS), so that testing and deployment environments are consistent and stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows/WSL2 THEN the system SHALL handle command execution without buffer overflow errors
2. WHEN file operations are performed THEN they SHALL work consistently across different operating systems
3. WHEN Docker containers are managed THEN operations SHALL complete successfully regardless of platform
4. WHEN long-running processes are executed THEN they SHALL not be terminated by platform-specific timeouts
5. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL provide the same performance characteristics across platforms

### Requirement 6: Chaos Engineering and Fault Injection

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want to inject controlled failures into the system during extended testing, so that I can validate the system's resilience and recovery capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chaos injection is scheduled THEN it SHALL execute at the specified intervals without system corruption
2. WHEN faults are injected THEN the system SHALL maintain core functionality and recover within defined SLAs
3. WHEN chaos events occur THEN they SHALL be logged with detailed context and impact metrics
4. WHEN the chaos window ends THEN the system SHALL return to normal operation automatically
5. WHEN multiple chaos events overlap THEN the system SHALL handle them without cascading failures

### Requirement 7: Resource Management and Leak Prevention

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the system to manage resources efficiently during long-term operation, so that performance remains consistent and resource exhaustion is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable with no upward trend
2. WHEN database connections are created THEN they SHALL be properly closed and recycled
3. WHEN file handles are opened THEN they SHALL be released promptly after use
4. WHEN background processes are spawned THEN they SHALL be cleaned up when no longer needed
5. WHEN resource limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement throttling and cleanup mechanisms

### Requirement 8: Comprehensive Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a monitoring specialist, I want detailed health metrics that provide early warning of potential issues, so that problems can be addressed before they cause service disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health checks are performed THEN they SHALL include application, database, and cache layer status
2. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL include response times, throughput, and error rates
3. WHEN resource utilization is monitored THEN it SHALL track CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
4. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN they SHALL trigger appropriate alerts and automated responses
5. WHEN historical data is analyzed THEN trends SHALL be identified and reported for capacity planning
